(v1.00) iconresource - V1.00 - FREEWARE
This package shows how to properly use the
WPS object setting ICON(N)RESOURCE when
refering to icons delivered in resource
DLLs. It is also taking care for the
differences between Warp 3 and Warp 4.
The package includes a REXX sample cmd and
source for a REXX-DLL, which is required for
using ICONRESOURCE under WARP 3.
